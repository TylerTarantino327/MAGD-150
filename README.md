## Lab Assignment 6 
For this lab, I had to use code to create a shape of my choosing and I decided to make a pumpkin. It mostly consisted of ellipses, traingles, and some color filling in these shapes.

## Lab Assignment 7
In this lab, I had to create a shape, object, etc. and make it my cursor, as well as give it a trace so whenever my mouse cursor moves it has a trail of its self follow from behind. I decied to use my pumpkin shape that I created from the L.A.6 as my cursor and then I to use some mouseX&Y bits of code to make it become my cursor and give it a trail. 

## Lab Assignment 8
For this lab, I had was required to find two images, add some text to it with a any type of font. What I did was that I choose two different kinds of dragons and assigned them to move differenlty from eachother depending on how I moved my mouse(if I moved my mouse horizontally one of them would move and vice versa for the other image)I then just put a title that said dragons at the top.
